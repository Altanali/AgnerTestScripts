### Instructions

To create simple tests: 

- Ensure you are in the directory ./PMCTest
- In ```PMCTestB.cpp```, insert the code you'd like to test in the section marked **"Test code start"**. 

	- If your code requires data to be declared and initialized, do so in the sections marked **"User data"** and **"Initializations"**, respectively; otherwise your data setup will be included in your performance measurement.
- Compile the test by running ```source c64.sh```, which will create the executable ```a.out``` and will run your ```a.out``` immediately.
